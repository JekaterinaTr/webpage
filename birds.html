							<h1>SQL and Tableau Data analysis project: </h1>
							<h1 font: style = "font-weight: bold;	font-size: 43px">Bird observations in French marine protective areas</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/birds2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this data analysis project I looked at the open source dataset on the bird observation events recorded by the French bird protection association (LPO). The dataset contains records of different animals (birds, molluscs etc) observed in natural marine protective areas at the northern and western coast of France (Côtes-d'Armor, Charente-Maritime and Vendée regions). </p>
							<p>The goal of this project was to get a clear idea about the bird observation events recorded.  The questions I was asking myself were, for example, how many different bird species were observed in each of the four different locations of the protected area? Which month of the year is the best to observe birds? What are the most frequently observed bird species? How does bird counting evolved over the last fourty years?</p>
							<p> The relevant information had to be extracted from the dataset and extensively cleaned up. All these steps were gone using SQL. For example, the following code allowed to create a new dataset contaning only relevant information and selecting only bird species among all the animals observed: </p>

							<p> The cleaned up data was then ready for analysis. With SQL I was able to make calculations and finally get answers to my questions.

								<p> I visualized this data using Tableau interactive dashboard:  </p>

							<p> The dashboard shows general trends on bird observations in the four natural protected areas. For example, on the northern coast area (Côtes-d'Armor) the best month of bird observations is august while january is the worth. Surprisingly, at the western coast area (Charente-Maritime) the trend is oposite with reduced observations during summer and increased in the winter. Is it because of migratory and wintering birds that arrive at the western coast during the winter? The trends are clear now but deeper analysis is required to explain them. </p>
							<p>This simple anaysis can already serve as a first step towards effectively organizing bird conservation efforts in these nature reserves. </p>
